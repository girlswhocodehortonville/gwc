	<h2> Music and Depression </h2>
	<p> 
	Listening to music may soothe many people. It is used in therapy sometimes even. 
	Music therapy allows patients to boost their mood and relax. Playing instruments 
	helps some people but many get frustrated. Studies have been carried out to prove
	music is a “treatment” for kids, teens and adults with depression. Those studies 
	show that music is not just for fun but can also be used to raise self-esteem. A 
	growing movement of music therapists and psychologists who are investigating the use 
	of music in medicine to help patients dealing with pain, depression and possibly even 
	Alzheimer's disease have found this to be true.
