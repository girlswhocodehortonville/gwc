	    Hello, we are Megan and Abby! Our project was a website that people could learn more about depression and what it is. On our website, we have 3 pages stories, tests, and facts. On the stories page, you can read about 2 different stories of people that have suffered depression. The tests page has 3 links to websites you can go to if you believe that you have depression. Our facts page has facts about depression so that you can learn more about it and its effects on the world.
