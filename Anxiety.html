 <h1>Anxiety</h1>
 
 <p>Anxiety effects about 18% of adults in the U.S. (about 40 million.) The most common types are generalized Anxiety disorder(GAD), specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, Seperation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism disorder.<br>
  Generalized anxiety disorder is a psychological disorder characterized by excessive or disproportionate fear about several aspects of life, such as work, social relationships, or financial matters.<br>
  Specific Phobias is any kind of anxiety disorder that amounts to an unreasonable or irrational fear related to exposure to specific objects or situations. As a result, the affected person tends to avoid actively direct contact with the objects or situations and, in severe cases, any mention or depiction of them.<br>
  Agoraphobia is an extreme or irrational fear of crowded spaces or enclosed public places.<br>
  Social Anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder in which a person has an excessive and unreasonable fear of social situations. Anxiety and self-consciousness arise from a fear of being closely watched, judged, and criticized by others.<br>
  Panic Disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which debilitating anxiety and fear arise frequently and without reasonable cause.<br>
  Separation Anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder in which an individual experiences excessive anxiety regarding separation from home or from people to whom the individual has a strong emotional attachment.<br>
  Selective Mutism Disorder is an anxiety disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people.</p>
  <p>Anxiety disorders typically happens from a lot of fear, but you can get it by genetics, brain chemistry, personality, and life events.
