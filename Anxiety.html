 <h1>Anxiety</h1>
 
 <p>Anxiety effects about 18% of adults in the U.S. (about 40 million.) The most common types are generalized Anxiety disorder(GAD), specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, Seperation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism disorder.
  Generalized anxiety disorder is a psychological disorder characterized by excessive or disproportionate fear about several aspects of life, such as work, social relationships, or financial matters.
  Specific Phobias is any kind of anxiety disorder that amounts to an unreasonable or irrational fear related to exposure to specific objects or situations. As a result, the affected person tends to avoid actively direct contact with the objects or situations and, in severe cases, any mention or depiction of them.
  Agoraphobia is an extreme or irrational fear of crowded spaces or enclosed public places.
  Social Anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder in which a person has an excessive and unreasonable fear of social situations. Anxiety and self-consciousness arise from a fear of being closely watched, judged, and criticized by others.
  Panic Disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which debilitating anxiety and fear arise frequently and without reasonable cause.
  Separation Anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder in which an individual experiences excessive anxiety regarding separation from home or from people to whom the individual has a strong emotional attachment.
  Selective Mutism Disorder is an anxiety disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people.</p>
