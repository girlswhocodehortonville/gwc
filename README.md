Welcome to Girls Who Code Hortonville 

navigation.css contains all the styles - colors, fonts, sizes, etc for the navigation and header
navigation.js contains the code for building the header and navigation bar

To include the header and navigation on a new page, add the script and style sheet references in the header of your page.

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="navigation.css">
	<script src="navigation.js"></script>

To add your page name or title, update navigation.js - all pages must be in here to be included in the navigation bar.
Include  <div id="headerContainer"></div> at the start of your page body.
